# Calculating Basketball Team Strength

This is a small Elixir program I wrote for calculating basketball team strengths
given a set of games, which ideally would be all the games from a season. It is an
implementation of 
[this paper](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/sites/default/files/eheit/files/basketball.pdf),
which will have more details on the idea and other things you typically find in a
research paper. It is written in Elixir as a small project to help me learn Elixir.

## Usage

Assuming you have Elixir on your machine, the way I've been running it, which is subject
to change very soon, is to open `iex` sourcing this file. From a clean directory, that is
```
git clone https://github.com/tarsir/{{REPO NAME FILL IN}}
cd {{REPO NAME}}
iex main.ex
```
And you should be able to enter it, warnings abound.

Yeah, this is kinda janky, but it's a first Elixir app and I wanted to get this done in
time to model game 7 of the Cavs/Warriors game.

## Well, what's it say about that?

+13 Cavs.
